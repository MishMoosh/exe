# Jvm Task

I have asked you to create a simple program to do with java versionings

## What it should do

THe program should respond with something similar to this

```
g@gtux ~  $ ./jvmprogram testjar.jar
What Java-vm do you want to use

1) openjdk-8
2) openjdk-11
3) openjdk-17
```

I should be able to select a number to execute the testjar.jar with my picked version

### FLAGS!!

The program should be able to skip the user input if a specfic flag is included in the arguments but I will leave that up to you
